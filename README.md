**Framingham Heart Disease Dataset**

**Introduction**

The Framingham Heart Disease Dataset is a longitudinal study of cardiovascular disease risk factors in over 15,000 participants from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The study began in 1948 and is still ongoing. The dataset contains a wealth of information on participants' demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular health.

**Dataset Description**

The Framingham Heart Disease Dataset is a CSV file containing over 4,200 records and 15 attributes. The following is a description of each attribute:

id: Personal identification number (Unique)
Demographic:
sex: Male or Female (Nominal)
age: Age of the patient (Continuous)
education: Education level of the patient (Ordinal)
currentSmoker: Whether the patient is a current smoker (Binary)
cigsPerDay: Number of cigarettes smoked per day by the patient (Continuous)
Medical History:
prevalentStroke: Whether the patient has had a stroke (Binary)
prevalentHyp: Whether the patient has hypertension (Binary)
diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes (Binary)
totChol: Total cholesterol level of the patient (Continuous)
sysBP: Systolic blood pressure of the patient (Continuous)
diaBP: Diastolic blood pressure of the patient (Continuous)
bmi: Body mass index of the patient (Continuous)
Lifestyle Factors:
physicalActivity: Level of physical activity of the patient (Ordinal)
alcoholIntake: Alcohol intake of the patient (Ordinal)

**Classification Goal**

The classification goal of the Framingham Heart Disease Dataset is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The target variable is TenYearCHD, which is a binary variable indicating whether the patient developed CHD within 10 years of the baseline visit.

***Usage***

The Framingham Heart Disease Dataset can be used for a variety of tasks, such as:

Training machine learning models to predict CHD risk
Conducting research on cardiovascular disease risk factors
Developing educational materials on cardiovascular health
To use the dataset:

Download the CSV file from the repository.
Open the file in a data analysis software package, such as Python, R, or SPSS.
Clean and prepare the data, as needed.
Train and evaluate a machine learning model to predict CHD risk.
Use the model to make predictions for new patients.
Conclusion

The Framingham Heart Disease Dataset is a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and machine learning practitioners who are interested in cardiovascular health and disease prediction.
